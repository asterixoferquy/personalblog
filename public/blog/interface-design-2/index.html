<p>Did you know that colours play a very important role in the way a living being perceives information? Colours are not just a topic in fine-arts but they are a science in itself. Don’t worry, I am not going to get into the physics of a prism converting the white light into rainbow colours. But if you are interested in it, please read <a href="https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/refrn/Lesson-4/Dispersion-of-Light-by-Prisms" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/refrn/Lesson-4/Dispersion-of-Light-by-Prisms</a>
 in your spare time. It is really interesting. Anyways, coming back to the topic of colours. Colours are so important when it comes to delivering information that just changing the hue or saturation value of a colour, can invoke a completely different feeling. If you are thinking how can such a petty thing as a colour make a big difference, ask yourself - why does the colour white represent peace or surrender?</p>
<p>A specific colour in one culture can mean something completely different in another culture. For example, in general, the solid colour red (Hex value: FF0000, RGB value: 255,0,0) represents fire, violence, warfare, love and passion. But, the same colour represents prosperity and happiness in China. In some countries, the colour red is worn by brides on their wedding days while in South Africa, the colour red represents mourning. In the ‘western’ countries, the colour red represents luxury and elegance - do you remember the ‘red’ carpet?</p>
<p>I know, I know, you might be thinking why is this guy so obsessed with colours? It is because the colour you choose in your user interfaces rises different emotions and feelings in the audience. In fact - and I apologise once again for referring to the colour red - it is found that the colour red raises blood pressure and respiration rate and also increases human metabolism (<a href="http://csef.usc.edu/History/2003/Projects/S0317.pdf"

).</p>

<p>Now, coming to the fun part. One tool that I have been constantly using to decide colours and shades for all my projects is <a href="https://coolors.co/generate" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>https://coolors.co/generate</a>
 . This is a free and cool tool to generate colour combinations. You can lock some colours and move them around to see how they match with other colours. There are many contributors to this tool who have already generated some awesome colour combinations. You can simply use them if you’d like to save time.</p>
<p>Now, something different from this topic. I know many of you are using WordPress.org for building your website. That’s completely fine. The major drawback of using that platform are the limitations related to designing components and the code structure. In that case, I recommend using a builder. Check out this blog to explore the best options out there: <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/best-drag-and-drop-page-builders-for-wordpress/" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/best-drag-and-drop-page-builders-for-wordpress/</a>
</p>
<p>I personally recommend Divi (paid) and Elementor (free + paid) from this list. All these builders also allow you to put custom code. Therefore, making your job quick as well as letting you customise certain aspects of your design.</p>
<p>If you are already using any of these, please feel free to post your views here. I would love to know your views on the colour theory.</p>
