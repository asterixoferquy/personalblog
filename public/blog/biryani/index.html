<p>Don&rsquo;t you miss that strong aroma of spices blended with beautiful golden and white texture of long grain rice? The delicately cooked vegetables and meat which doesn&rsquo;t require a lot of effort to chew while it melts in your mouth leaving a smile of content and satisfaction on your lips? Yes, you guessed it right. I am talking about the world-renowned delicacy - &lsquo;Biryani&rsquo; (well, the title of this post must have given away the answer). Known to have originated in Persia (modern day Iran), the Biryani has now become one of the most popular signature dishes in the Indian and Pakistani cuisine. In India, the ingredients and process of cooking Biryani is as diverse as its people. But wait, let&rsquo;s step back a little. what do you mean by the term &lsquo;Biryani&rsquo;? And how did it travel all the way from Persia to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent#:~:text=Geographically%2C%20it%20is%20the%20peninsular,Nepal%2C%20Pakistan%20and%20Sri%20Lanka." 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>Indian subcontinent</a>
? Let&rsquo;s check it out.</p>
<p>The term &lsquo;Biryani&rsquo; is derived from the Persian term &lsquo;Birian&rsquo;, which means &lsquo;Fried before cooking&rsquo; and &lsquo;Birinj&rsquo;, which means &lsquo;rice&rsquo;. You might think that it&rsquo;s a royal dish but a few centuries ago, on the lands of Persia, it was considered a food of nomads as it required less utensils for cooking and eating and was very simple to prepare.</p>
<p>In the 14th century, the great legendary Turco-Mongol conqueror <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timur#Military_leader" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>Amir Timur</a>
 founded the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timurid_dynasty" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>Timurid Dynasty</a>
. After expanding his kingdom into most of Persia and central Asia, finally defeated the Sultan of Delhi (then known to be one of the richest cities in the world) Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughluq. It is believed that his soldiers introduced the concept of Biryani in the Indian subcontinent, bringing it all the way from Persia. Biryani was essentially cooked during their days of fighting battles and the method was simple. They dug a pit in the ground, heated it, and put a large earthen pot in it. The pot was filled with rice, meat and some spices. This simple recipe helped soldiers gain all the strength required to get back into the fight with all their will and energy. This type of Biryani was known as the Kacchi Biryani - or - as we now know it as Lucknowi Biryani because this form became quiet popular gradually in the city of Lucknow situated in northern India.</p>
<p>Emperor Timur did not expand his kingdom beyond Delhi and soon lost his life on his campaign against Ming China. The Timurid dynasty went into a downfall during the period of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timurid_Renaissance" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>Timurid Renaissance</a>
. The empire was divided into six parts. Timurid dynasty looses its grip in the central Asia however, Zahir-ud-din Muhammad Babur, the great-great-great-grandson of Amir Timur from his paternal side and a certain number of &lsquo;greats&rsquo;-grandson of Genghis Khan from his maternal side, progresses to conquer India. He establishes his own dynasty - The Mughal Dynasty (which comes from the Arabic and Persian terms for the word &ldquo;Mongol&rdquo;). He entered modern day India after conquering kingdoms in present-day Afghanistan and Pakistan and captured much of the Northern Indian kingdoms. It was under this dynasty that Biryani gained its popularity in the subcontinent.</p>
<p>When it comes to Biryani and the Mughal empire, there is a very interesting story. It is said that Queen Mumtaz Mahal - the beloved wife of Shahab-ud-din Muhammad Khurram, also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Jahan" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>Shah Jahan</a>
 - usually accompanied the Mughal Emperor on his battles. On one such occasion, she visited the barracks of her soldiers and was shattered to see their declining health. The war had taken it&rsquo;s toll on the kingdom&rsquo;s treasury as well. With less monetary resources and diminishing health of soldiers, the kind-hearted queen came up with a dish which required less cost to prepare and consisted of a well-cooked and balanced dietary meal. Rice, gravy and meat was cooked separately with spices and put in a heated pot layer-by-layer. This pot was then sealed with dough to let the dish cook in its own aroma and trapped heat to make it more flavorful. This method of cooking is called &lsquo;Dum&rsquo;. Hence, it was known as &lsquo;Dum-Pukht Biryani&rsquo;, also known as &lsquo;Pakki Biryani&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Biryani soon travelled from the battlefields to the Royal kitchens. It is said that when famine hit the city Awadh situated in the north of India, Biryani was cooked to feed the people. This Biryani was cooked in a slightly different way. All the ingredients of a typical Biryani were put in a pot and the pot was sealed. It was cooked with fire underneath and charcoal at the top. This was known as Awadhi Biryani. The Nawab of Awadh, Asaf-ud-Daulah grew extremely fond of this Biryani and asked his chefs to cook a version of it with exotic, expensive and rare meat and spices.</p>
<p>It is impossible for someone to talk about Biryani without referring to the city of Hyderabad in India. I believe Hyderabad is popular for two major reasons - the beautiful Charminar and the delicious Hyderabadi Biryani. When Mir Qamar-ud-din Khan Siddiqi Bayafandi, or also known as Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah I was appointed as the ruler of Hyderabad by the Mughal emperor, with him the Hyderabadi Biryani was introduced. It is said that the chefs of the Nizam cooked over 50 types of Biryanis with the very exotic and expensive spice saffron being its key aromatic ingredient.</p>
<p>So, what type of Biryani are you having today?</p>
<p>ðŸ’¡ <strong>Something Interesting</strong>
In current day Iran, which is known to be the birth place of Biryani, the street-food &lsquo;Birian&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t even contain rice. In fact, it is made from covering chunks of meat with paper-thin bread.</p>
