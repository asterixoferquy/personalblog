<p>In order to know and understand the events in history, it is vital to understand the timeline. To understand timeline, it is important to decode the denotations for years. I mean understanding the full form and meaning of terms BC, BCE, AD and CE. Before we being, it is important to understand the concept of an ‚Äúyear‚Äù. An ‚Äúyear‚Äù that is universally accepted and followed comes from the Georgian Calendar (also commonly known as ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù or ‚ÄúWestern‚Äù calendar). It is based on the movement of planet Earth around the Sun and consists of 365 days divided into 12 months irregularly. An year is divided into 52 to 53 weeks each of which is further divided into 7 days. I have written a separate blog on the history of Georgian Calendar. For now, this level of information should be sufficient.</p>
<p>So let‚Äôs begin!</p>
<p>Sometime in 6th century AD, a Christian monk named Dinysius Exiguus suggested that one should use the BC/AD system and the pope at that time accepted it. Over time, people around the world started accepting it. Of course, there were many countries which didn‚Äôt start adopting the BC/AD system until as late as the 20th century. These countries included Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Russia.</p>
<p><strong>BC</strong> - BC is an abbreviation for ‚ÄúBefore Christ‚Äù. It refers to the period before Jesus Christ was born. It marks the period before year 1 of the Georgian calendar. The years in BC (or before year 1) are counted in a reverse order. For example, when one says 200 B.C., it means 200 years before Christ was born.</p>
<p><strong>AD</strong> - AD is an abbreviation for the latin term ‚ÄúAnno Domini‚Äù which means ‚ÄúIn the year of our lord‚Äù in English language. It is the year Jesus Christ was born. The year 1 can be written as 1 AD. The year prior to 1 AD is 1 BC. The years in AD are counted in the normal order. Therefore, the current year, 2020 can also be written as 2020 AD.</p>
<p>Since BC and AD focused on a particular religion - Christianity, many countries and started adopting a new system - CE and BCE. Usage of CE and BCE was introduced by England and Wales in 2002 in its education curriculum. This system was soon followed by Australia and other countries in their education systems. The concept of CE and BCE are not new actually. Its usage has been found in texts dating back to 1708.</p>
<p>So what is CE and BCE?</p>
<p><strong>BCE</strong> - BCE is short for ‚ÄúBefore Common Era‚Äù. It represents the time similar to BC and can be used interchangeably.</p>
<p><strong>CE</strong> - CE is short for ‚ÄúCommon Era‚Äù. It represents the time similar to AD and can be used interchangeably.</p>
<p>Therefore, 2000 AD is same as 2000 CE, and 2000 BC is same as 2000 BCE.</p>
<p>If one just uses a number for an year without using any letters following it (which is a common practice now), it is by default considered as AD or CE. One only needs to use the letters if years from both BCE and CE are used in a single sentence.</p>
<p>For example, The Roman Principate began in 27 BC and ended in 284 AD. In this case, one needs to add 284 + 27 to find the number of years the Roman Principate lasted. Therefore, we get the result as 311 years.</p>
<p>üí° <strong>Something Interesting</strong>
There are few countries today which have still not adopted the Georgian Calendar. They are Ethiopia, Nepal, Iran and Afghanistan.</p>
