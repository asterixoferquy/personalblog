<p>Did you know that the height of the highest mountain above sea level - Mount Everest - is 29,029 feet? Did you know that sunlight can penetrate clean ocean water up to a depth of 240 feet? Or did you know that the Moon&rsquo;s diameter is 11404000 feet? But have you ever wondered whose feet are we talking about here? Mine? &hellip; Yours? Well, let me answer that question.</p>
<p>Long time ago, when people wanted to measure distance, they did not have the luxury of long measurement tape. They used their own feet to measure distance by simply walking the distance and calculating the number of steps they took to walk from on point to another. They started calling it &lsquo;feet&rsquo; in England. This was a very common practice especially in the rural areas of the English kingdom. Even though it appears to be a very simple and handy way of measuring lengths and distances, as you can imagine, the measurement of a &lsquo;feet&rsquo; would differ not only amongst countries, but also from city to city.</p>
<p>The value of feet was fluctuating from 12 to 16 inches depending on which culture or place you belonged to. The Greeks considered a &lsquo;foot&rsquo; to be 9 inches. The Romans who lived in the main city decided that a &lsquo;foot&rsquo; is 11.64 inches. Whereas the Romans living in the rural areas considered a &lsquo;foot&rsquo; to be 13.15 inches. Now you might be wondering why should one make life difficult by measuring in decimal values? Well, here we are talking about the &lsquo;Imperial&rsquo; system. The whole point of giving it a royal term was that most of the standards came from the rulers. The measure of Emperor Maximilian&rsquo;s foot was found to be 11.64 inches whereas the measurement of Military commander Nero Drusus&rsquo;s foot was 13.15 inches.</p>
<p>Finally, King Henry I of England came up with a law. He declared that the length of his foot shall be measured, and that value would become the standard measurement of &lsquo;feet&rsquo; in all of England. This measurement was almost 12 inches. Back then, an average person was believed to be shorter as compared to today and so was their foot. Therefore, there are many historical records that say that boots were worn while taking the measurement.</p>
<p>In 1959, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, the United States of America, South Africa, and New Zealand signed a treaty by the name of &lsquo;International Yard and Pound Agreement&rsquo;. This standardised the various units of measuring weight and lengths. Hence, feet is used in both, Imperial as well as United States Customary systems.</p>
