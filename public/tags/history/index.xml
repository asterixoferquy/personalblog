      <description>In 1832, the Bombay (now Mumbai in India) Magistrates of Police decided to extend a regulation which was issued in 1813. This regulation mandated the Indian street dogs within public and government properties to be killed every year between April to May and September to October. This rule was in place to control the growing population of stray dogs. Dogs are of religious significance in the Parsee community. Hence, things got really tense around the holy day of Parsees in July 1832 and they started protests against this regulation.</description>

On the Christmas eve, the soldiers on both sides sang Christmas carols and played musical instruments. At sunrise on the Christmas day, both forces came out of their trenches, walked to the no-man&amp;rsquo;s land, shook hands with each other, and sang songs.</description>

      <description>Did you know that the height of the highest mountain above sea level - Mount Everest - is 29,029 feet? Did you know that sunlight can penetrate clean ocean water up to a depth of 240 feet? Or did you know that the Moon&amp;rsquo;s diameter is 11404000 feet?
