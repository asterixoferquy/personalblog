In 1832, the Bombay (now Mumbai in India) Magistrates of Police decided to extend a regulation which was issued in 1813. This regulation mandated the Indian street dogs within public and government properties to be killed every year between April to May and September to October. This rule was in place to control the growing population of stray dogs. Dogs are of religious significance in the Parsee community. Hence, things got really tense around the holy day of Parsees in July 1832 and they started protests against this regulation. They were soon joined by other communities like Hindus, Muslims and Jains. This event was the first riot in the modern history of Mumbai.
