As the competition increases in the global economy with unstable environments, many organisations have implemented IT solutions in the last three decades to make their organisation more effective and efficient. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) being one of the most popular of them. The growing use of ERP and its strategic importance has always sparked the interest of researchers. The companies that aggressively expand into new markets and look for new opportunities (often known as prospectors) make the best use of ERP systems compared to those which do not take many risks and are just concerned about keeping a strong grip on their current market (often known as defenders).

# What is ERP?
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is designed to manage all functions and business processes while providing employees with a unified view under one source (Klaus, Rosemann, & Gable, 2000). These functions can be finance, human resources, sales, projects, procurement, etc. 
ERP is the source of an organisation’s information. Hence, large enterprises are seen using these systems heavily. Small scale enterprises use a lightweight version of the ERP to come up with business plans and solutions. ERP is the most important information technology of all the systems being used by organisations for the past few decades (Agourram, 2009).
ERP was usually bought by large organisations only. But as the usage of this tool gave these organisations an edge over competitors, SMEs also wanted to take advantage of the tool and during the same time, ERP became more affordable (Olsen and Saetre, 2007). Noticing this trend, vendors combined SAP with ERP to offer a different set of options to SMEs so they could implement a version that exactly fulfilled their needs (DePompa, 2003).  

For large ERP implementations, this can mean a major investment and risk for any organisation. The implementation can cost anywhere between $3 million to $100 million (Ross & Vitale, 2000). In 2014, the investment in the ERP software market was $27.6 billion, it is expected to grow to $48.2 billion by 2022. ERP is in so much demand as there is a growing need for efficiency and transparency in organisations.   

It is an arduous task to implement ERP systems and functionalities in an organisation.  It takes time to incorporate and harmonize the organisation according to the system’s requirements (Hendricks, Singhal, & Stratman, 2007). The Introduction of ERP needs unprecedented organisational changes (Volkoff, 1999). The implementation of ERP involves making sure that all tools work well with the ERP to produce the required information. This is very time-consuming and costly (Rouse, 2014). Lack of skills in implementing ERP, ineffective strategic planning, and communication gaps can cause the ERP system to fail too (Motwani, Mirchandani, Madan, & Gunasekaran, 2002). Cultural issues within the organization, employee usage training costs, choosing the right consultant, and top management’s involvement throughout its development process are also important for a smooth ERP implementation (O'Leary, 2004).  

The complexity of ERP ensures that all steps from implementation to the users are extensively probed, be it the cultural impact and the readiness of the employees at a pre-implementation stage or the maintenance required to post the implementation (Law, Chen, & Wu, 2010). This research paper will explore the issues and success factors in depth.
