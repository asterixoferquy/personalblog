As the competition increases in the global economy with unstable environments, many organisations have implemented IT solutions in the last three decades to make their organisation more effective and efficient. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) being one of the most popular of them. The growing use of ERP and its strategic importance has always sparked the interest of researchers. The companies that aggressively expand into new markets and look for new opportunities (often known as prospectors) make the best use of ERP systems compared to those which do not take many risks and are just concerned about keeping a strong grip on their current market (often known as defenders).

# What is ERP?
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is designed to manage all functions and business processes while providing employees with a unified view under one source (Klaus, Rosemann, & Gable, 2000). These functions can be finance, human resources, sales, projects, procurement, etc. 
ERP is the source of an organisation’s information. Hence, large enterprises are seen using these systems heavily. Small scale enterprises use a lightweight version of the ERP to come up with business plans and solutions. ERP is the most important information technology of all the systems being used by organisations for the past few decades (Agourram, 2009).
ERP was usually bought by large organisations only. But as the usage of this tool gave these organisations an edge over competitors, SMEs also wanted to take advantage of the tool and during the same time, ERP became more affordable (Olsen and Saetre, 2007). Noticing this trend, vendors combined SAP with ERP to offer a different set of options to SMEs so they could implement a version that exactly fulfilled their needs (DePompa, 2003).  

For large ERP implementations, this can mean a major investment and risk for any organisation. The implementation can cost anywhere between $3 million to $100 million (Ross & Vitale, 2000). In 2014, the investment in the ERP software market was $27.6 billion, it is expected to grow to $48.2 billion by 2022. ERP is in so much demand as there is a growing need for efficiency and transparency in organisations.   

It is an arduous task to implement ERP systems and functionalities in an organisation.  It takes time to incorporate and harmonize the organisation according to the system’s requirements (Hendricks, Singhal, & Stratman, 2007). The Introduction of ERP needs unprecedented organisational changes (Volkoff, 1999). The implementation of ERP involves making sure that all tools work well with the ERP to produce the required information. This is very time-consuming and costly (Rouse, 2014). Lack of skills in implementing ERP, ineffective strategic planning, and communication gaps can cause the ERP system to fail too (Motwani, Mirchandani, Madan, & Gunasekaran, 2002). Cultural issues within the organization, employee usage training costs, choosing the right consultant, and top management’s involvement throughout its development process are also important for a smooth ERP implementation (O'Leary, 2004).  

The complexity of ERP ensures that all steps from implementation to the users are extensively probed, be it the cultural impact and the readiness of the employees at a pre-implementation stage or the maintenance required to post the implementation (Law, Chen, & Wu, 2010). This research paper will explore the issues and success factors in depth.  

# How is an ERP system implemented?  

There are various methods to which an enterprise resource planning system can be implemented, the four most common approaches are namely, the big bang, the phased rollout, the parallel adoption approach, and the five-stage ERP implementation process. Each of which has its unique characteristics and, typically organizations have to consider which implementation methodologies suit the firm better.  

Neal (2010) has unraveled that from its empirical research, the most favourable implementation methodology is the phase rollout methodology, representing approximately 40% of the choice in its sample population. That being said, phase rollout implementation methodology is the installation of ERP systems through changeovers that happen in intermittent phases and the users adopt the ERP system in organised and planned steps. Instead of an implementation that happens in a single instance, the phased rollout accommodates small changes over time, allowing the organization to shift from a legacy information and resource planning system to a contemporary system over a series of predetermined steps.  

The second most used implementation method is the ‘big bang’ method, which represents about 38% of the sample population (Neal, 2010). In comparison to the phased rollout method, the big bang method facilitates all implementation to occur in a single instance. Instead of rolling out the implementation part by part, the big bang organizes the implementation of the ERP system in a single and major event. As the implementation of ERP systems occurs all in one large lump of actions, its preparation and planning phase plays an even more critical role.  

The third method of implementing an ERP system is called parallel adopting, it describes the implementation methodology in which the new ERP system is implemented whilst the old system is kept for a while before the new is fully adjusted and adapted (Jianxin, Xiaoyuan, Dunming, Bifeng, Bihong, Shengyong, & Hongtao, 2013). This is the least risky implementation process; users can learn the characteristics of the new systems while continually performing their work duties on the old system (Dezdar and Haghighi, 2014).  

The five-stage implementation process is a comprehensive life-cycle approach to the development of ERP systems and was suggested by Ehie & Madsen (2005) based on their studies on previous methodologies. It is a highly structured approach starting from project planning and moving on to understanding the business background and processes, developing the software application, testing and tuning the system, and finally deploying it in the company environment.  

# Organisational issues in implementing ERP systems

Companies are heavily investing and relying on enterprise software applications to manage smoothness in business flow and support innovative processes (Woods, 2011). According to Gartner (2011), ERP systems make a worldwide market size of approximately $114 billion. The implementation of ERP systems impacts both, business as well as organizational capabilities of an organization. It is vital to understand the company’s business strategy to decide on ERP implementation. According to a research conducted by HassabElnaby, Hwang, & Vonderembse (2012), companies with prospectors as their business strategy achieve the highest level of organizational capabilities and financial performance. This is because prospectors tend to seek better information to improve their decision-making process compared to defenders and analysers since a high level of risk is involved. An ERP system is capable of handling cost control, new product developments, and deployments which are a basic necessity for prospectors.  

Approximately 30 percent of the firms implementing ERP systems are mining and construction industries, transportation and utility firms form 19 percent, 40 percent constitute durable goods and less than11 percent firms come from the business and customer services background (HassabElnaby et al., 2012). Hence, almost 45 percent of the ERP implementations belong to the category of manufacturing industry. The reason being ERP systems evolved from manufacturing and production planning systems used by manufacturers in the 1990s and the scope of ERP systems further expanded to back-office processes such as finance, human resources, finance, and accounting, etc. (Swartz & Orgill, 2001). An ERP system is built to enhance the company’s performance rather than creating turmoil in the business growth.  

Many factors are responsible for success or failures of ERP systems but only a few are related to information technology while rest are all strategic, human resource and project management related (Zare Ravasan & Mansouri, 2016). Aligning the underlying ERP system with the organizational culture is a critical issue affecting the growth of the organization. If there is a misfit between the organizational culture and the system, a company may not be able to establish itself in different markets due to the system’s lack of support for the new markets and lack of senior management support (Chiang, 2013). Implementing ERP systems is a heavy financial and time investment. If the organization stakeholders are not confident about the technology, usage or outcomes of the system, it may lead to project abandonment.  

The project management methodology applied during implementing ERP systems in an organization plays a crucial role. Poor monitoring and controlling of the system implementation and lack of skilled team members leads to project failures. Usually, it is noticed that scope is overestimated and the project cost and time is underestimated (Aiken, 2002). Since ERP systems link almost all the back-offices of an organization, the implementation team needs to understand and cater to changes in organizational culture, business processes, and strategies to avail the most benefits of the system. 
Employees of the organization (or users of the system) should be comfortable accepting and using the ERP system to avoid frequent user incidents. Studies and experiments have been conducted to check how the users of the system have faced issues interacting with complex ERP systems due to lack of technical knowledge, poor quality of training in using the ERP system and identifying critical tasks and incidents (Oja & Lucas, 2011). If the system is too complex for the user to understand and interact with, this will lead to repeated annoyance amongst the user and lack of end-user support.  

ERP systems bring about minor as well as in some cases major changes to the organization’s business processes to improve efficiency and performance of the organization. This introduces employee resistance to its adoption (Seo, 2013). The organization is responsible for resolving and managing these conflicts between business and technical staff and releasing regular memos to the employees in advance explaining their importance and key success elements.

## Issues in large enterprises

A few ERP implementation issues can be highlighted using some real - life case studies such as that of The Water Corporation (Mandal & Gunasekaran, 2003). The Water Corporation is a large agency providing water, drainage, and irrigation services to the entire state of Western Australia and boasts an annual turnover of over AUS $900 million (2011). The company decided to implement a SAP based corporate ERP system to centralize its business processes which were previously handled by multiple legacy systems. After following each step of the development methodology, the new system was finally deployed. The system started facing minor issues which escalated to major ones. The problem was with the SAP-PS scheduling module which was responsible for automatically forecasting start and end dates of processes within the system. After an investigation, it was found that the scheduling package was not powerful enough to cater to the company’s environments. This occurred due to flaws in project planning and lack of clarity in understanding business requirements which lead to faulty and poor business process designs. Finally, even though the ERP was deployed, the planning and scheduling functions (which the SAP-PS scheduling module was responsible for doing) were carried out manually.  

Another case study to highlight issues in implementing ERP systems in a large organization is that of The Hershey Company (Gross, 2013). The Hershey company is the largest manufacturer of chocolates in North America with annual revenue of USD 7.42 billion (2014). The company in 1996 thought of upgrading and consolidating its legacy IT systems into an ERP system. They chose SAP’s R/3 ERP software along with supply chain management (SCM) software from Manugistics and customer relationship software (CRM) from Seibel. The company invested of USD 10 million and was told that the system would be ready within 4 years. To rush its deployment fast, Hershey’s demanded the system to be up and running in 2 years. In pressure to accomplish this schedule, the development team submitted the ERP software without going through the testing phase. Since the big bang approach was used in its implementation, the company immediately launched the software without any further consultation. Due to lack of diligence from the business as well as implementation teams, the faulty ERP produced problems in order fulfilling, processing and shipping schedules. The inventory started to pile up and increased to 25% more than last year. This issue caused an 8% decrease in the company’s stock price in a single day and a loss of USD 150 million in sales.  

## Issues in small and medium enterprises

ERP is being implemented at a very fast pace in SMEs but there is a clear trend of these companies not fulfilling their expectations related to improvement and utilization post ERP implementation. The major reason for this lack of success is a poor implementation. In 2000, over 90 percent of SMEs failed in their initial attempt to implement ERP systems (Donovan,2000). 
In many cases, the ERP implementation cannot meet the implementation deadline because of unrealistic schedule planning and lack of clarity related to the ERP implementation timeframe (Martin, 1998). In China, most organisations fall under the SME category, they usually have issues related to IT human resources, where they have a lack of manpower and IT infrastructure issues, where there are insufficient resources to ensure smooth operation of the ERP system. (Liu & Zhou, 2001).  

The obstacles most SMEs face are related to transitioning from old systems to the ERP system, important team members switching jobs during the ERP implementation and lack of skilled IT resources (Tsai, Chien, Fan, & Cheng, 2004). 
ERP systems can provide a well-built system but they solely never lead to a satisfactory result without teamwork during the ERP implementation. If the top management does not involve team members during initial stages and have no incentives attached to the implementation process then team members will be reluctant to share their knowledge and key information related to internal processes will go missing (Chien, Hu, Reimers, & Lin, 2007).  

Comparative differences between team members’ skills and working hours can create conflicts between teams. They can have different opinions on how to perform a task and when to perform that task. In project environments, employees are usually working on multiple projects, this may lead them to focus on other projects hence delaying the ERP project (Wang, Chou, & Jiang, 2005). Because of these issues, teams that cannot work together will cause dysfunctional ERP implementations.  

SMEs are focused on cost reduction; this is how they survive in the competitive market. If they opt to customize their implementation of ERP, there are major issues related to assessing the real cost involved in implementing the system.  This causes a lot of dissatisfaction in the top management. The customized nature of the implementation makes it very difficult to calculate the timeframe of the implementation and due to ignorance, the organisation faces confusion on which set of tools to use (Scheer & Habermann, 2000).  

This lack of clarity encourages the organisation to use a standardised version of ERP. Apart from all of this, the biggest issue related to ERP implementation is undertaking the humongous task of Business Process Reengineering(BPR) and customization steps involved. PeopleSoft and SAP calculated that the ERP software license costs three times less than the implementation of ERP. Ascending costs of software and hardware increase the overall costs more (Scheer & Habermann, 2000).  

# Success factors in implementing ERP systems

Effective utilization of the ERP system has proven to give a competitive edge to SMEs (Blanchard, 1998). In the 1990’s, it was noticed that SMEs were growing 1.5 times more than large companies. This led to more SMEs looking for solutions tailored to their specific needs (Sun, Yazdani, & Overend, 2005).  

There have been many theories of critical success factors (CSF) related to ERP. A critical success factor is an important dimension, which when focused on, can improve chances of a successful implementation of the project (Pinto & Slevin, 1987). According to a recent study, most of the large enterprises focus on project management and evaluation as CSFs followed by senior management support compared to small and medium enterprises which focus the most on gaining senior management support followed by communication and cooperation amongst teams (Aarabi, Saman, Wong, Azadnia, & Zakun, 2012). According to the same research conducted, large organizations tend to focus the least on vendor support. Whereas SMEs focus the least on underlying appropriate business and IT legacy systems in place.  

There is no set agreement on the number of critical factors. The ones mentioned in most papers are mentioned here:
1. Project management and evaluation
2. Selection of ERP packages
3. User involvement
4. Organizational culture alignment with ERP
5. Appropriate Business and IT legacy systems in place
6. Proper implementation strategy and methodology
7. Use of external ERP consultants
8. Vendor support
9. System analysis, testing, and maintenance
10. Monitoring and evaluation of implementation process
11. User training
12. Business process re-engineering
13. Senior management support
14. Change management support
15. Communication and cooperation amongst teams  
    
Senior management support during the implementation of the project is a major success factor. This support can be buoyed through incentives and a sound compensation policy (Nah, Lau, & Kuang, 2001).  

Communication and cooperation within the organization play as important a role as any other CSF in ERP implementation. The quality of communication amongst business and IT teams determine the quality of the resultant ERP system. The company has to “sell” the new ERP system to its employees for them to accept the change and use it proactively (Aladwani, 2001). The technical innovations within the company best promoted by the senior management to its employees are the most quickly accepted system (Piazolo & Felderer, 2016). Since implementation and acceptance of the new ERP system involve business process re-engineering per the system, it also tests the company’s change management capabilities.  

A recent ground-breaking study by Gavidia (2016) suggests that a major critical success factor in ERP implementation is the impact of conflicts between parent and subsidiary companies in a large multinational organization (MNC). Data collection for implementing a common ERP system in such organizations involves dealing with multiple data sources. If the managers do not consider conflict issues during the planning phase of the system, the implementation can prove to be an extremely expensive and longer-than-expected process. Proper knowledge flow amongst the departments and its management play a crucial role in the effectiveness of communication and coordination within the organization (Migdadi & Abu Zaid, 2016).  

The implementation of ERP system aims to provide various benefits to the firm. In comparison to non-ERP legacy systems, the ERP system aims to support most the informational and planning need for most business functions in a single database, which is accessible to the business as a whole. Nwankpa (2015) has expressed that, ERP, as a back-office system, attempts to achieve important benefits that improve business productivity by decreasing time gaps between two gaps, lowering overall costs and efficient communication among all teams. Nwankpa has referred to the ERP system as the order fulfilment process. The ERP system also benefits the firm through the provision of high information accessibility. Information recorded by the ERP system will typically be accessible by all different departments that will potentially need the information.  

That being said, one of the greatest benefits brought by the ERP system is its capability of improving information handling efficiency and accuracy. The ERP system will generally streamline business processes and the information is filled out and handed down from one process to another, making the information collection and handling process much easier and efficient for companies to collect data. Staehr, Shanks, and Seddan (2012) have expressed that the implementation of ERP system flushes out inefficiencies caused by inefficient management. The legacy system that requires manual information handling and entry are typically subject to managerial factors. If management control for information handling is poor, it’s highly unlikely for the information handling process to be efficient. The adoption of an ERP system resolves the reliance of information handling on managerial efforts. The fact that information is more automated and electronically managed and generated makes it somewhat less subject to human errors. 
Secondly, integration of information is another benefit provided by the ERP system. Instead of having information or data being distributed throughout several separate databases, all information is centrally located in a single physical location. The integration of data and allowance for central management of information makes information management more cost effective.  

It is also expressed that ERP system is capable of providing high-quality customer service (Nwankpa, 2015). Sales and customer service can utilize the unified information database provided by the ERP system to better interact with customers and be more responsive and specific to customer’s needs. Thus, the implementation of ERP systems can improve customer relationships via faster and more accurate access to customer information and history.

# In conclusion

Most studies conducted in the area of organizational issues and success factors in implementing ERP systems suggest that large organizations can enjoy most of the benefits of using the system. Prospector enterprises are the usual implementers of ERP to help them understand, analyze and manage their aggressive expansion in new markets. ERP was originally introduced and used by the manufacturing industry to simplify their Supply Chain and Change Management systems but later other industries adopted them as well. ERP consolidates all the legacy systems of an organization into a single unified system with data coming from all legacy system sources.  

Several implementation methods are proposed by researchers but four most widely used methods are discussed in this report. Most organizations consider the phase rollout method because of its step-by-step development and acceptance capabilities. 
Implementation of every new system will face organizational issues but the few most common ones included lack of alignment between the ERP system technology and organizational culture, poor monitoring and control of the implementation, employee acceptance of the new system and unrealistic schedules and timelines. The cases of The Water Corporation and The Hershey Company explain how these issues may lead to project failures and even major monetary losses.  

All the critical success factors involved in implementing ERP systems affect greatly on the privacy of the system (Misra, Singh, Jha, & Bisui, 2016). To satisfy these success factors, organizations should not compromise on the system’s privacy.  

There is no doubt that ERP brings a lot of good cards on the table but needs to adhere to a lot of success factors and organizational issues to get the best and most profitable outcome.
