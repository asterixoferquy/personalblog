There is often a dilemma between making something complex and making something beautiful. Yes, I said ‘beautiful’ and not ‘simple’. Something complex in the back-end doesn’t mean it has to be confusing in the front-end. I have come across many applications that are packed with amazing functionalities and very well-thought back-end code design but simply lack a good interface. The outcome? Either I feel the system is too complicated to even consider using it or even if I use it, I lose interest in no time. Yes, I mentioned that I ‘feel’ and not ‘think’. I believe an interface should be used as a key to ‘feel’ the system rather than merely a way to work with it. Over the years, many tech giants have spent billions of dollars in hiring psychologists, scientists and IT professionals to build the best user experience for their customers. Just in case you are wondering, this is NOT a script for Apple’s next iPhone release. I am not that lucky - yet.

My strong suggestion would be to utilise their work in the best way possible for your projects and make your products, no matter how complex they are, feel awesome! I have gathered a few resources which will help you achieve that awesome UI/UX. Some of these you might already be aware of. If your studio and industry mentors, potential users, and friends think that your product already looks and ‘feels’ awesome, maybe this will help you make it even better.

1. If you are designing an iOS application, you can make use of Apple’s design resources. They are all available here: [https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/) . It includes the official Apple’s San Francisco, San Francisco Pro, and New York fonts. It has all the symbols and UI elements for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS applications. They are all free to download. Just utilise them rather than creating your symbols from scratch. This will save time and your application will look as beautiful as Apple’s native applications.
   
2. If you are serious about UI/UX designing and would like to build your career in it, which includes BAs who are looking to work more towards the front-end, I highly recommend buying and downloading the application - Sketch. Unfortunately, it is only available for macOS, but you can design android applications, web and desktop applications, and of course applications for Apple platform. You can find it here: [https://www.sketch.com/](https://www.sketch.com/) . It is used by giants like Google, Tesla, and Porsche for their product and brand design. Don’t worry, it's not too complicated to use. I have been using it for the last 4 years for all my projects.
   
3. If you have got feedback saying that, “you need to improve your UI” or “your UI looks like stitched together by multiple people” or “your UI is too complicated and it needs to be standardised across all pages/screens” or “it looks too primitive”, I suggest you as a team to stop everything, sit together, and come up with a design specification/guideline for your product. All the companies have it. That’s how even if thousands of developers from across the world are working on a single product, it looks as if its made by one person. It documents a set of design rules for the entire team to follow when it comes to developing anything and everything related to their product - including documentation. It should all look like one. Here are some examples of design guidelines:
   
    - [https://mozilla.design/firefox/](https://mozilla.design/firefox/)
    - [https://www.microsoft.com/design/](https://www.microsoft.com/design/)
    - [https://design.google/resources/](https://design.google/resources/)
    - [https://material.io/design](https://material.io/design)

They are all free to download and use.

I hope these tips are useful for now. I will come back soon with more resources and tips.
