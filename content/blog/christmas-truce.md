During the World War I (1914 - 1918), just 5 months into the war, Pope Benedict XV proposed a temporary break for Christmas celebrations. The countries involved denied this proposal but the soldiers in many of the trenches located on the Western Front declared a temporary cease-fire unofficially. On the Christmas eve, the soldiers on both sides sang Christmas carols and played musical instruments. At sunrise on the Christmas day, both forces came out of their trenches, walked to the  no-man's land, shook hands with each other, and sang songs. They even exchanged gifts of cigars and cakes. This act was never repeated again.
