# **1.**

Every time a new version of the products was to be released, the software developers in the Research and Development team spent a lot of time manually editing and updating the version details in all the code libraries and software products they developed. Each product has a set of developers building it with their own versioning conventions. I was tasked with interviewing each set of developers and to figure out a mechanism to automate this process. 

Based on the requirements, I wrote software code to automate this process using C#.Net and Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) framework. It automatically updated versioning information of each library, patch, update and software product of the company. This code saved a lot of developers' time by running as part of the batch processes in the build and production server and improved system development efficiency.

The company was developing a new one-of-a-kind product and I was a part of performing its proof of concept. I gathered and analysed requirements from both, internal and external stakeholders and configured the new features of the products in a way that eliminated the possibility of error in its outputs. For doing so, I had to perform field and software tests, collect output data generated from these products, and use advanced Microsoft Excel to identify defects and anomalies in the data. I was also responsible to document the users' requirements, configuration and test environment, and results of my data analysis. These results were then used by the software developers of various products and other key internal stakeholders to plan, fix and enhance the systems to provide optimum results to the user.

The software tests, test cases, references to backlog items and bugs, various test results and artefacts were not maintained in a systematic form. The the product owner, developers and software testers spent a lot of their time in searching for test results to track product performance. I noticed this issue and started investigating it by interviewing a few developers in the team and researching through various mediums for existing solutions. 

I then approached my Project Manager with a few recommendations in our one-on-one meetings. He appreciated the ideas and asked me to start working on them with the senior Quality Assurance Engineer. We came up with a quality management plan which involved streamlining the software delivery process by introducing certain automated testing along with the existing manual processes. I was also responsible for documenting these processes and coming up with standards for writing and maintaining test cases and test suites. 

- This reduced the overall quality assurance delivery time by up to 20%
- Introduced quick accessibility to test results
- Improved products' performance tracking.

The technology division of Monash University - eSolutions used BMC Helix Remedy as its ticket management, change management, and problem management solution. I was tasked with integrating the Business Intelligence reporting and analytics tool - BMC Smart Reporting with BMC Remedy, automating reports and dashboard generation on this tool, and train team leaders and managers from across multiple teams in its usage. All of this had to be done in most cost-effective way. 

I first started by gathering requirements through one-on-one interviews, questionnaires, user observation of current work environment and finally group interviews/workshops. I then transferred all of these business requirements into functional requirements, and documented and presented them to my project manager. Upon getting the approval, I followed the following steps:

- Setup naming conventions and data standards for the reports and dashboard for the new BI system
- Automate reports and dashboards generation process within the BI system to cater to users' requirements
- Spin-up an Apache server with various security protocols
- Write automation scripts to export certain specific reports and dashboards from BMC Smart Reporting to the Apache server only accessible to the directors and top management

This project improved:

- the overall transparency, performance, work efficiency, and accountability of various service delivery teams within eSolutions
- decision making for team leaders, directors and top-level management
- teamsâ€™ issue management response time to 20%

# 5.

The University had to procure two major automation tools - one an organisation wide employee rostering system, and a mass incident notification tool. These tools were to be used by over 400 internal and external stakeholders of Monash University. I was responsible for gathering, analysing and documenting requirements from managers, team leaders, and directors through one-on-one interviews, questionnaires, user observation of current work environment and finally group interviews/workshops. 

Since it involved many teams across the business, I had to choose a sample of users and managers to perform requirements elicitation. Based on these requirements, I produced the following documents:

- Requirements specification document
- Request for Information
- Request for Proposal
- Request for Quotation

I then was in continuous communication with various vendors and acted as a liaison between them and my project manager while organising proof of concepts and implementation meetings.

My team was responsible for learning, implementing, adapting and acting as subject matter experts for the operational intelligence tool - Splunk. I underwent training in the system's usage and its infrastructure. I then was a part of coming up with business use cases for implementing Splunk in the University environment. I then acted as a liaison between the data warehouse team and my team to implement Splunk pipeline which observed and analysed students' location data within the Monash University campuses based on their connectivity to the University's Wi-Fi routers. This data was then used to map and forecast the student population at specific locations at specific times during the day. This enabled University to plan and setup important student services booths at or near those specific locations to provide the best possible services in the most accessible way.
